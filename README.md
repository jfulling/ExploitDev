## Tools

To assist with the hands-on portion of the presentations, I developed a script that will take a string and a value representing the target CPU register size, and convert it into a reverse string that can be pushed onto a stack and used as a ![guiding tool for this slide](https://github.com/jfulling/ExploitDev/tree/master/2%20-%20Shellcode%20Authoring#path-buffering).

Usage: ```python3 string-to-shellcode.py <target string> <Target Register Bitsize>```
